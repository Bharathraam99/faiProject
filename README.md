# FAI Project

Our project will focus on portfolio optimization techniques. We aim to evaluate and compare three different algorithms for optimizing a financial stock portfolio, assessing the risk and return. We will implement and analyze Genetic Algorithms, Reinforcement Learning, and the Markowitz Mean-Variance Optimization. These approaches have different methods for balancing both risk and return and will provide a good comparison for finding the optimal technique.

Instructions to run

# Genetic Algorithm
1. Run genetic_algorithm/data_tranformation.py -> Prepares the data (cleaned dataset, covariance matrix, mean returns) from raw data for the genetic algorithm
2. Run genetic_algorithm/main.py -> Runs the genetic algorithm for portfolio optimization
3. genetic_algorithm/processed_data/optimized_portfolio.csv -> Has the end result
4. genetic_algorithm/processed_data/portfolio_allocation.png -> End result visualization

# Reinforcement Learning
1. TODO
   
# Markowitz Mean-Variance
1. TODO

# Compare Results
1. Run algoComparator.py to get the comparison of all the three models

# Misc
1. If you want the model to be trained on latest data run newDataGeneration.py
