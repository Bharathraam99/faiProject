# FAI Project

Our project will focus on portfolio optimization techniques. We aim to evaluate and compare three different algorithms for optimizing a financial stock portfolio, assessing the risk and return. We will implement and analyze Genetic Algorithms, Reinforcement Learning, and the Markowitz Mean-Variance Optimization. These approaches have different methods for balancing both risk and return and will provide a good comparison for finding the optimal technique.
